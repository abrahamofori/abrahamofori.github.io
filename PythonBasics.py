#print(8/5) # Division always returns a floating-point number

# The integer numbers (eg 2,4,-2,...) have data type int
# And the ones with fractional parts, 6.2,1.8 have data type float

# For floor division to get an integer, we use // operator
#print(17//3)
#print(17/3)
#print(17%3)
# % operator returns the remainder of the division, modulus
